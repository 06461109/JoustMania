Pairing controllers
---------------------------

* once you have installed PiParty, in order to pair controllers, plug them into the raspberry pi via usb, and wait until the bulb turns white. 
* This process should only need to be done once, after this the controller should be permenently paired and will only need to be turned on via the circular sync button on the front of the move controller for any future games
* All the controllers may restart when pairing, this is expected, just keep plugging in new ones until they are all paired. if you encounter problems restart the pi.

Games (More coming soon!)
---------------------------------
* In order to change between games, on any controller press the select button (located on the left side)
* The colors of the controllers show which game is selected, for example, for FFA, all controllers will be white
* Press start (located on the right side) on any controller to launch the selected game, a countdown until the game starts will begin!

Joust
---------------------------------
* Based off of the original [JS Joust](http://www.jsjoust.com/)
* The aim of the game is to force all the other players to move their controllers too fast, either by hitting the controller, making them flinch, or anything else you can think of
* The sensitivity of the controllers is tied to the music, when the music speeds up, you are able to move faster
* If your controller is going too fast it will flicker and vibrate as a warning.
* If you are knocked out, your controller goes dark and vibrates.
* The last player standing has their controller flash a beautiful rainbow sequence, and all controllers vibrate to indicate the end of the game.

 FFA (all controllers are white)
 ---------------------------------
 * The most basic version of Joust, Be the last one standing!

 Teams (all controllers are solid colors)
 ---------------------------------
 * This game is the same as Joust FFA however at the beginning players select their team color with the big button in the middle of their controller
 * There are six teams to select from

 Random Teams (all controllers changing colors)
 ---------------------------------
 * Same as Joust Teams, however the teams are randomly assigned at start of play
 * There are three teams in this mode

 WereJoust (one controller red, the rest white)
 ---------------------------------
 * Same as Joust Teams, although there is one hidden "Werewolf" on one of the teams
 * When the countdown starts the werewolf will feel a vibration, letting that player know they are the Werewolf
 * The Werewolf is on their own team, and will win only if they are the last player remaining
 * There are two regular teams in this mode

 Zombie apocalypse
 ---------------------------------
 * two players start out as zombies, and try to infect the humans
 * humans can get bullets to shoot random zombies, by killing zombies
 * humans try to survive for a couple of minutes, otherwise zombies win!
 

 Commander
 ---------------------------------
 * teams are split into two sides
 * one commander is chosen for each side, if this commander dies, the other team wins
 * commanders can activate special abilities that helps their team win.
